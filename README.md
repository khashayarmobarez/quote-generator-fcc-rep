this project is made by khashayar mobarez haghigh.
made this project with usage of only class components.

this project idea has came from the freecodecamp organization course and it is part of the final projects of the course

This is a simple web application that generates random quotes with their respective authors to inspire and motivate users. The application is built using **React** and serves as a great introduction to React components, state management, and event handling.

To use the application, simply click on the **Generate Quote** button to display a new quote. You can also share the quote on Twitter by clicking on the **Tweet** button.

The application is built using the following dependencies:

- `react`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `react-dom`: A package that provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app.
- `marked`: A package that converts markdown text into HTML.
- `remarkable`: A package that converts markdown text into HTML.
- `web-vitals`: A package that measures the performance of your web app.

To run the application, you can use the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will install the required dependencies and start the development server.

To build the application for production, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build of the application in the `build` directory.

For more information on how to use React, please refer to the [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

I hope this helps!
